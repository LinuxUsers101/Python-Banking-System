A simple command-line banking system implemented in Python. This project allows users to create bank accounts with secure authentication, manage balances with deposits and withdrawals, and simulate transferring cash between 'pockets' and bank accounts.

1) Account creation with validation for names, 8-digit account IDs, and 6-digit PINs.

2) Secure login with PIN verification and limited PIN attempt retries.

3) Bank account management including deposit and withdrawal functions.

4) Cash management between in-bank balance and pockets.

5) Input validation using regular expressions.

6) User-friendly command-line interface to perform various banking operations.

What I have learnt
Object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes and methods to organize banking logic with Input validation using regular expressions to ensure correct data formats and Simple user authentication with PIN verification and limited login attempts
Command-line interface (CLI) programming for user interaction additional a Basic financial transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers finally Handling program flow control and error messages for a good user experience
